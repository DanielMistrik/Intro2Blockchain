# Background

This book is meant for the introductory course on the Blockchain
taught by the Blockchain club at Cornell. The course was first
offered in Fall 2021 and has been offered every semester since. 
Each time we, the teaching staff, try to improve the course and
this textbook is one such improvement, first introduced in 
Spring 2022.

We want to thank everyone in the Cornell Blockchain for their
contribution to the course and the textbook. 



:::{note}
One of the reasons for this textbook is that 
information on the Blockchain is often scattered and 
hard to verify. At the end of each chapter we will have a list
of sources we deem reputable and ones we base the text on 
but the final decision on validity will always be up to you.

The formatting and structure is inspired by Cornell professor 
Michael Clarkson and his [CS3110 textbook](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html).
