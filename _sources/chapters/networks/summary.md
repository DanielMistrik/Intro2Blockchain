# Summary
We covered how the blockchain network works. We went into the details
of how nodes coordinate to manage the blockchain data structure.
* The Blockchain network is a collection of nodes that store the same Blockchain data structure 
* Nodes are divided by their responsibilities into ‘full’ and ‘light’ categories with the light
nodes sacrificing utility for efficiency.
* Consensus makes sure that honest nodes always have the same version of the blockchain. This
process happens independently at every node but always reaches the same conclusion.
* Consensus algorithms guarantee consensus across a blockchain and they come in differnt
types like Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake.
* Forking is the situation when two valid chains exist on a blockchain. This can 
either be because of a Proof-of-Work accident or an intentional change of blockchain rules.
* Miners are nodes that are responsible for generating new blocks and blockchains
often incentivize them because block production is vital to a blockchain's validity.
* Miners often pool resources to earn more or more stable returns for the extra
effort it takes being a miner.
* There are different types of Blockchain for different use-cases. These 
include public, private and permissioned blockchains.
* Blockchain is a solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem by combining a 
novel data structure, cryptography and network architecture.
