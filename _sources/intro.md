# Preface

This book is meant for the introductory course on the Blockchain
taught by the Blockchain club at Cornell. The course was first
offered in Fall 2021 and has been offered every semester since. 
Each time we, the teaching staff, try to improve the course and
this textbook is one such improvement, first introduced in 
Spring 2022.

We want to thank everyone in the Cornell Blockchain for their
contribution to the course and the textbook.
