a user calling themselves <em>Satoshi Nakamoto</em> published a whitepaper on a
crypto mailing list. This whitepaper described an electronic peer-to-peer
currency called <em>Bitcoin</em>. The genesis block was published in January of 2009
and Bitcoin came to life.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You might be confused why we referred to Bitcoin’s creator in plural. This
is because <em>no one</em> knows who Satoshi Nakamoto actually is. It could be
a single person, a group or even a company, we just don’t know. Many have tried
to uncover this secret but have come short. For those interested in learning
more about Satoshi Nakamoto we recommend <em>The Book of Satoshi</em> by Phil Champagne.</p>
</div>
<p>Although Satoshi never mentioned the word in the whitepaper, Bitcoin introduced
us to Blockchain. This was by no means an accident. Bitcoin’s goal was to
decentralize finance and in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis the
idea had backing. The whitepaper argued that the financial system being a
<em>centralized</em> one was a problem and that a <em>distributed</em> system would be
advantageous. The blockchain solution therefore addresses the drawbacks of a
distributed system to make it usable.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s blockchain was therefore created to support decentralized token
exchange. Participants could exchange the blockchain’s native token, <em>Bitcoin</em>,
without the need for any central authority. For much of 2009 the blockchain
was in the realm of enthusiasts as the token didn’t even have a trade-able value.
This changed in October, a little less than a year after the whitepaper, when
the first exchange of Bitcoin was launched offering 1,305 BTC for 1$. The
cryptocurrency continued its rise and eventually became the behemoth we know it
as today.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was the genesis project for Blockchain and as of 2022 it is still the
most popular project. Understanding Bitcoin will help us get a better
perspective on blockchain. In this chapter we will go into the details of
the Bitcoin implementation.</p>
<div class="section" id="bitcoin-summary">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.1.1. </span>Bitcoin Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#bitcoin-summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bitcoin is a <em>PoW</em> public blockchain that is created to support the exchange
of its token. A run-down of the project is as follows:
<br/><strong>Token</strong>: The Blockchain’s native token is <em>Bitcoin</em>. The maximum
supply of <em>Bitcoin</em> is capped at 21 million.
<br/><strong>Participant Rights</strong>: Bitcoin is completely open and permissionless
so anyone can join as a participant and have full read &amp; write rights.
<br/><strong>Consensus Algorithm</strong>: Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work with SHA-256 hash
puzzle. The difficulty is readjusted every 2 weeks to keep <em>ABCT</em> constant.
<br/><strong>Data</strong>: Bitcoin data is token exchanges called transactions.
<br/><strong>Average Blockchain Creation Time (<em>ABCT</em>)</strong>: 10 minutes.
<br/><strong>Mining Incentive</strong>:The block creator is rewarded with the native token
<em>Bitcoin</em> from transaction fees and a general block reward.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin is a network that can be accessed through a publicly-known
<em>port</em> it is typically run on a software implementation called <em>Bitcoin
Core</em>. There are multiple implementations out there, you could even create
your own, but 96% of nodes use <em>Bitcoin Core</em>. The software manages a bitcoin
full node and typically makes all the choices for the node. Its development
history can be traced all the way back to Satoshi Nakamoto and is now hosted
as an open-source project on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bitcoin-block-transaction">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.1.2. </span>Bitcoin Block &amp; Transaction<a class="headerlink" href="#bitcoin-block-transaction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bitcoin’s block is around 1MB with the header being 80 bytes. Most of the
space is taken up by transactions. The block header is composed of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Version</strong> - The version of the software implementation like Bitcoin Core.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Previous Block Hash</strong> - The link to the last block in the blockchain linked list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timestamp</strong> - The unix timestamp for when the block was produced. Can be 2 hours
off and still be valid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merkle Root</strong> - The root of the merkle tree containing the transactions in the block.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Difficulty</strong> - The difficulty of the hash puzzle. Nodes use this value to
calculate the target.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nonce</strong> - The input field miners can use to change the block header so it
solves the hash puzzle.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The bitcoin block header is very bare-bones. This is because space is incredibly
limited so any redundancy is removed. When every node, regardless of type, has
to store every block header, with a new one being added every 10 minutes, even
a single byte adds up.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Alot of blockchain projects differ on the block size. This is because it’s
a very sensitive issue as <strong>space vs throughput</strong> is a hotly debated topic in
the blockchain world. Some original contributors to Bitcoin got into a bitter
argument about whether Bitcoin’s block size should be increased. This feud is
covered in detail in <em>The Block Size Wars</em> by Jonathan Bier.</p>
</div>
<p>Bitcoin’s data is transactions and transactions are concerned with token exchange. Each transaction
is composed of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Version</strong> - Like in the block header the version denotes the version of the
software implementation and so the rules the transaction has to follow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Input Counter</strong> - The number of inputs in this transaction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inputs</strong> - A list of inputs used in this transaction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Output Counter</strong> - The number of outputs in the transaction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outputs</strong> - A list of the actual outputs used in this transaction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LockTime</strong> - A field that prevents this transaction from being used for
a given period, largely deprecated except for the Lightning Network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delegated Witness</strong> - A Segwit feature that is out of the scope of this textbook.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Transactions are often bigger than the block header itself because there is
a fair level of complexity in them. One of these complexities is deciphering
what inputs and outputs are. For the following paragraph think of them as simply
where the bitcoin is coming from, inputs, and where the money is going, output.</p>
<p>To validate a transaction we need to check the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are the inputs valid? (We will discuss this shortly)</p></li>
<li><p>Are Inputs &gt; Outputs?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The order in the list is arbitrary we can do either one first. You might be
wondering why the latter point isn’t Inputs=Outputs. This is because the difference
between the inputs and outputs forms the transaction fee. The transaction
fee is the incentive for the miner to include your transaction in their
block as often there are more transactions than space in blocks. Transaction
fees can be 0 and the transaction will eventually be included in a block
but that could be several hours, if not days, after the transaction was
first broadcast.</p>
<p>Bitcoin transactions can be ordered within the merkle tree in any order
the miner wants except for the first one, the <em>coinbase transaction</em>.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Yes, that is where the popular crypto exchange got its name from.</p>
</div>
<p>If you remember the last chapter, we talked about how one part of the
mining incentive is a piece of data in every block that is inherently correct.
In Bitcoin this is the coinbase transaction. The coinbase transaction
is how the miner rewards themselves for winning the hash puzzle and publishing
a block. The input of the
coinbase transaction is irrelevant, it’s often the place of the extra nonce.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>As Bitcoin mining got more competitive miners were discovering that the 2^32
possible nonce values solved the hash puzzle. They then started to change
the timestamp as time passed by but sometimes not even that was enough. This
is when the data in a coinbase transaction started to be used as an <em>extra
nonce solution</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>While we don’t need to verify coinbase inputs we need to check that the miner has not
rewarded them-self with too much bitcoin. The coinbase transaction output has to
equal the block reward, which is well-known by the network, and the sum of
all the transaction fees of the transactions in the block. If the output is
larger than that the whole block is rejected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="utxo-model">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.1.3. </span>UTxO Model<a class="headerlink" href="#utxo-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will now talk about the inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>When we think of managing
money we think of having an account with a balance. This has the benefit
of being a simple way to think about one’s finances, but it has a drawback: space.
Every account, no matter how big or small, needs to have an account and balance
and this leads to redundancy. This is a big problem for the space sensitive
blockchain so Bitcoin decided to only record unspent payments. This way accounts
with no payments or an empty balance won’t fill the blockchain.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s model isn’t the only one used by blockchains. Projects like
Ethereum use the standard account &amp; balance model known as the <em>state model</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>To do this Bitcoin reimagined what a payment is and how we store money. In
Bitcoin a transaction is just a collection of inputs and outputs. Inputs
are former outputs that are assigned, via a digital signature, to a
particular entity. Outputs are a certain amount of Bitcoin being assigned
to a new entity. Your ‘balance’ is now the sum of all the outputs you
are yet to put into a transaction. These outputs are known as <em>unspent
transaction outputs</em> and give this finance-tracking model its name, the <em>UTxO
model</em>.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>By entity we just mean an address that has a public/private key. This
‘entity’ could be an individual, group or even company.</p>
</div>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/Output.png"><img alt="../../_images/Output.png" class="align-right" src="../../_images/Output.png" style="width: 190px;" /></a>
<p>Bitcoin outputs are relatively simple. They are arranged in a list, where order matters,
and are composed of an amount and <em>lock script</em>. This lock script is a
script verifies the digital signature of the entity it was issued and has to
be <em>unlocked</em>, the digital signature must be verified, for the output to be
used as an input.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/Input.png"><img alt="../../_images/Input.png" class="align-right" src="../../_images/Input.png" style="width: 190px;" /></a>
<p>Bitcoin inputs are a bit trickier. They are composed of the hash of the
transaction they were an output in, their index in the list of outputs of that
transaction and the unlocking script that proves the digital signature. Each
input must reference a single <em>unspent</em> output which means this input is
the only input, in the entire blockchain, to reference the output.</p>
<p>Inputs and outputs therefore have a <em>one-to-one</em> relationship. This means
that unspent outputs, from now on <em>UTxOs</em>, can only be spent in full. But
what if we want to send a payment with an amount that none of our <em>UTxOs</em>
can sum to? The answer is in the fact that a single transaction can have
multiple inputs <em>and</em> multiple outputs. To solve our problem we just collect
<em>UTxOs</em> that sum to more than we want to pay and anything left over after
the payment and transaction fee is made into a separate output addressed
to ourselves, a refund output.</p>
<div class="tip admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Alice wants to send Bob 30 bitcoins with a 1 BTC transaction fee. She
has the following unspent <em>UTxOs</em> to choose from:</p>
<table class="colwidths-auto table">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p><em>UTxO</em></p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Amount (BTC)</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>A</p></td>
<td><p>5</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>B</p></td>
<td><p>30</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>C</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Alice will be spending a total of 31 BTC and the closest sum <strong>that is greater
than that</strong> is A + B. A&amp;B sum to 35 BTC so Alice will also be creating
a 4 BTC refund output. We can therefore express the inputs &amp; outputs as follows:</p>
<p><ins>Inputs:</ins></p>
<table class="colwidths-auto table">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Output</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Digital Signature</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>A</p></td>
<td><p>Alice</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>B</p></td>
<td><p>Alice</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><ins>Outputs:</ins></p>
<table class="colwidths-auto table">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>To</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Amount (BTC)</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Bob</p></td>
<td><p>30</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Alice</p></td>
<td><p>4</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This transaction would be valid as the sum of inputs is 35 and the sum of
outputs is 34. The 1 BTC difference is the transaction fee paid to the miner.
Alice has now lost <em>UTxOs</em> A&amp;B and her balance has dropped from 85 BTC to
54 BTC with a new <em>UTxO</em> of amount 4 BTC.
Note the table representation is an oversimplification.</p>
</div>
<p>Using the UTxO has a number of implications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong> - Outputs and inputs can be used when the locking/unlocking
script is satisfied. Bitcoin has a number of locking scripts with the
most popular being <a class="reference external" href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/p2pkh">p2pkh</a> which
uses addresses. But different locking scripts work with multi-signature addresses
and even bare public keys.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy</strong> - Outputs in a single transaction can have different recipients and
inputs can be unlocked with different digital signatures.
This has the benefit that we can disperse our funds over a number of addresses
increasing one’s anonymity as it is more difficult for someone to track
our balance.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A <em>Dust Attack</em> is an attack vector that tries to weaken the latter feature.
We will cover this in detail in the following chapters.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>P2PKH</strong> (Pay 2 Public Key Hash) scripts work through Bitcoin addresses.
Bitcoin addresses are, like classic addresses, hashed public keys but in
Bitcoin they are encoded in <em>Base 58</em> format to make them more readable.
All Bitcoin addresses begin with a 1 to make them easy to differentiate.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><strong>Base 58</strong> format is an encoding format that is a more-readable version of
<em>Base 64</em>. Base 64 is a number system with 64 numerals. They are represented by all the
capital letters, un-capitalized letters, numerals 0 to 9 and + and /. Base 58
removes characters that are frequently confused, like 0 and o, and has a built-in
check that detects if you wrote it wrong.</p>

<div class="section" id="bitcoin-script">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.1.4. </span>Bitcoin Script<a class="headerlink" href="#bitcoin-script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reviewing what we now know about transactions and <em>UTxOs</em> data(transaction)
validation in Bitcoin breaks down into 2 steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the sum of outputs smaller than that of inputs?</p></li>
<li><p>Are all the inputs unlocked correctly?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer to both is yes then the transaction is valid. But how does
the network actually check this? While it may be tempting to say that the
software implementation, like Bitcoin Core, solves this that is not the case.
Because the network has to be unanimous with all of its decisions’ data validation
is done through a single programming language, <em>Script</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Script</strong> is a low-level stack-based programming language that does
the processing nodes need to do for Bitcoin. Script, which is reminiscent of
the old programming language Fortran, was originally developed by Satoshi
Nakamoto. Script is used for transaction verification and where locking/unlocking
scripts exist. It is <em>non-turing complete</em> which means what it can do is limited.
This might seem like a drawback but is actually a very intentional feature
to prevent a malicious attacker from creating very complicated Script code
that could slow the network down.</p>
<div class="admonition-stack admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Stack</p>
<p>Stacks are a very important low-level data structure in CS. They are a
<em>FIFO</em> (First-In First-Out) list where you add and take from,<em>pop</em>, from the
top of the stack. You can liken it to a stack of pancakes. You add the pancakes
on top and have to first eat the pancakes on top.</p>
</div>
<p>Script is a programming langauge that isn’t like the languages you might know,
such as Python or Java. Script is made up of operation codes, represented through
1 byte of hexadecimal. Script works by adding these <em>op codes</em> onto the stack
along with any data, like addresses, the <em>op codes</em> need to work with. The <em>op
codes</em> then take the data from the stack and produce a new value. The <em>op
codes</em> at the top are executed first.</p>
<p>Below is an example of the code for a p2pkh locking script:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">OP_DUP</span> <span class="n">OP_HASH160</span> <span class="mf">62e907</span><span class="n">b15cbf27d5425399ebf6f0fb50ebb88f18</span> <span class="n">OP_EQUALVERIFY</span> <span class="n">OP_CHECKSIG</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Script is not intuitive and is very limited for the sake of efficiency. Most
bitcoin developers will rarely, if ever, interact with Bitcoin Script as software
implementations are expected to be the only ones that deal with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bitcoin-operation">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.1.5. </span>Bitcoin Operation<a class="headerlink" href="#bitcoin-operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will now examine how Bitcoin works day-to-day through the lens of
transactions.</p>
<p>For this section we will be looking how Alice can send 10 BTC to Bob. We
start by creating the transaction. Alice, or more precisely her <em>wallet</em> software,
keeps track of all her <em>UTxOs</em>. This is not a completely trivial task as
for the sake of privacy Alice can have <em>UTxOs</em> addressed to a number of her
addresses.</p>
<p>Before she can select her <em>UTxOs</em> Alice also needs to consider
the transaction fee. Transaction fees are completely up to Alice and while
she could have no transaction fee this is has some consequences. Although
Bitcoin transactions are time-weighted, so eventually the transaction will
be put into a block, transactions with 0 or very small fees can take hours,
if not days to be added to the blockchain. The ‘average’ transaction fee is
dictated by the market with supply &amp; demand. If there are very little
transactions being broadcast, fees are relatively low, if there are alot
of transactions then fees are high. Wallet software almost always track
the average transaction fees so Alice doesn’t have to worry about this much.
For the sake of simplicity lets say that Alice’s wallet software tells her
the average transaction fee is 1 BTC, and she decides to use that amount.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Bitcoin transaction fees are amount-blind which
means that they are roughly the same for a 1BTC transaction and 10000 BTC
transaction. Miners just look at the fees not the amount transferred in the
transaction.</p>
</div>
<p>Now Alice knows that she needs to spend a total of 11 BTC, she can now
start finding the <em>UTxOs</em> to use. After some searching, by her wallet
software, Alice found three <em>UTxOs</em> that sum to 13 BTC, so she will also
need to have a refund output of 2 BTC. Her transaction will therefore have
3 inputs, the <em>UTxOs</em>, and two outputs, one output locked by Bob’s address
worth 10 BTC and one locked by Alice’s address worth 2 BTC. Alice then
organizes this into a formal transaction and then broadcasts it to
the network. Wallet software typically has its own node, can be either full
or light, through which it broadcasts Alice’s transaction to the network.</p>
<p>Now Alice’s job is done. She created the transaction and now has to hope she’s
done everything correctly. When nodes receive the transaction they verify the
data. First they check the sums of output and input and after that verify
that all the <em>UTxOs</em> are unspent and unlocked by the unlocking script. They
do this by searching for the <em>UTxOs</em> in their <em>UTxO</em> set that every node maintains.
If all the <em>UTxOs</em> are there the transaction is valid. If the transaction
passes validation it is stored in the nodes <em>mem pool</em> as a valid but unconfirmed
transaction. The node then propagates the transaction onwards to the rest
of the network. Propagation throughout the network is done in seconds.</p>
<p>After Alice’s transaction is in their mem pool, miner nodes can decide
whether they include the transaction in their candidate block. This
decision is important for Alice as a transaction isn’t truly confirmed until
it’s included in a valid block. For large payments some vendors wait until
the transactions has 6-confirmations which means the transaction is in a
valid block that is at least 6 blocks below the current block height.
Miners choose the transactions on their own so different candidate blocks
will most likely have different transactions and merkle roots.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Technically Bob doesn’t have to wait for Alice’s transaction to be added
to a block. This is called a <em>0-confirmation</em> transaction, and it is a very
fast but very risky way of accepting Bitcoin transaction in return for
real-world products. All that Bob, or his software, has to check is that the
transaction is valid and so work with the idea that the transaction will
<em>eventually</em> get confirmed by a block,</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s say that a miner by the name of Carl decides to include Alice’s transaction
in his candidate block. Carl decides to put Alice’s transaction as the second
one in his transaction list, the first position is reserved for the
Coinbase transaction which Carl constructs after he assembled the rest
of the transaction list. Carl’s coinbase transaction amounts to a
whopping 100 BTC, 6.25 from the Block Reward (As of 2022) and 93.75 from
transaction fees including Alice’s. Carl gets straight to solving the hash
puzzle and after around 10 minutes since the last block was added Carl solves it.</p>
<p>He immediately broadcasts the block to other nodes that verify the block.
This includes verifying transactions, the coinbase transaction, whether its output is equal to the block reward
&amp; transaction fees, and checking whether the block header hash is below the target. Carl’s
block is valid and nodes add his block to their own versions of the Bitcoin
blockchain. As the nodes do this they clean up the mem-pool and UTxO set so
the <em>UTxOs</em> Alice used as inputs are deleted and the ones she created as outputs
are added, her transaction is also erased from the mem-pool. As soon as Bob’s
wallet software receives this block it informs him of the successful transaction.</p>
<p>Bob now has a new <em>UTxO</em> of 10 BTC and his transaction with Alice is complete.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.5.1. </span>SPV Nodes<a class="headerlink" href="#spv-nodes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Simplified Payment Verification</em> nodes are Bitcoin’s light nodes. They only store
the block headers and are able to prove transactions are recorded in the
blockchain through merkle paths provided by full nodes. They were included
in Bitcoin’s whitepaper and are a solution to how space-limited parties
can actively participate in the blockchain.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>SPV nodes heavily utilize something called <em>Bloom Filters</em>. If you have ever
taken Cornell’s <a class="reference external" href="https://cornellcswiki.gitlab.io/classes/CS2112.html">CS2112</a> this should
be a refresher. Bitcoin is very privacy-centric and to make sure that full nodes
can’t track what transaction an SPV node is interested in it uses bloom filters.
Rather than asking for one particular transaction, a node sends a binary sequence
bloom filter which tells the full node to return all the transactions whose
hash in binary has <em>at least</em> 1’s in the same place as the bloom filter.
If a bloom filter is all 0’s then the node returns all the transactions while
a more specific bloom filter, with more 1’s, is efficient but less anonymous.</p>

<p>In the preceding section we mentioned wallets alot, but what actually are
they. In the most basic terms, a wallet is just a collection of public &amp;
private keys. However, these uber-simplistic wallets are rarely used as
they don’t provide any of the convenient features like <em>UTxO</em> tracking or
transaction creation &amp; broadcasting. Popular wallet software provides
users with all the features they need to use Bitcoin without ever having
to worry about the details.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

by all other cryptocurrency blockchains. The following types of wallets

<p>Wallets are one’s key, pun intended, to the blockchain. As Blockchains are

<p>The following two types differ on whose responsibility the wallet is.</p>
<p><strong>Custodial</strong> wallets are kept safe by a third-party <em>custodian</em>. The
custodian has access to the private/public keys so when you lose your
password or the wallet itself, if its hardware, your crypto is safe and
access can be restored. While custodial wallets are more forgiving
it comes at the cost of a severe reduction in privacy and dependence
on the custodian’s legitimacy and security. As the custodian has access
to the keys, and therefore the funds, if they are malicious or their security
is broken your funds are at risk.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Custodial</strong> wallets are completely yours. No one else has access
to them offering a strong degree of privacy but at the cost of
being completely your responsibility. If you lose the keys or the wallet
the crypto funds controlled by them are as good as lost, this has
happened before. They are primarily used by privacy-centric individuals
or those who posses a large amount of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">4.1.6.1.2. </span>Hot v Cold<a class="headerlink" href="#hot-v-cold" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The following types differ on where and how they are stored.</p>
<p><strong>Hot</strong> wallets store their public-private keys online, often behind a
layer of protection. They are usually custodial and have the benefit
of quick processing of transactions. Transactions can be signed and
therefore broadcast immediately and effortlessly. This makes them a
popular choice for online exchanges but their security is limited. Because the
keys are online their security is down-graded from ECDSA-grade to the
quality of the wallet’s online security. This has been a problem more than
once with one notable case being an early Bitcoin exchange called
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/">Mt. Gox</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cold</strong> wallets on the other hand store their keys completely offline,
typically through hardware. They are almost exclusively non-custodial.
They are more secure as no online hacker can access them, but they shift
the entire burden of maintenance onto their owner. If they are lost or
damaged the crypto funds controlled by them are put under risk. They
are nevertheless the most popular choice for privacy-centric users, some
go as far as printing their private keys on a piece of paper and putting it in
a safe.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">4.1.6.1.3. </span>Wallets &amp; Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#wallets-keys" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>While we mentioned that wallets’ primary function is to store keys
we are yet to mention how they do that and, arguably more importantly,
how they are generated.</p>
<p><strong>JBOK</strong> (Just a Bunch Of Key) Wallets are just that. Just a bunch of
keys. The keys are generated randomly and kept in a secure place. JBOK
wallets are relatively straightforward, in theory, but are very fragile
as losing the place where they are stored constitutes an irreversible loss
of the wallet. Further if the wallet implementation is badly built and uses
ordinary pseudo-random software to generate keys your funds might be at
stake even if you did everything right. JBOK wallets were the original
type of wallet on Bitcoin but have largely been phased-out by <em>HD wallets</em>.</p>
<p><strong>HD</strong> (Hierarchical Deterministic) Wallets are built on a mathematical
model. Keys are generated from a single seed, long binary sequence, that
can be represented as a mnemonic. So long you remember the mnemonic
the seed can be constructed and so can an infinite, 2 billion child keys from
each parent, number of derived keys. This makes HD wallets backup-friendly
and the default for backup-concerned wallets like MetaMask or Ledger. The
drawback is that the security of the HD wallet depends on the privacy of the
seed/mnemonic. If the mnemonic is leaked your funds are under threat, although
there are implementations which encrypt the mnemonic with a password.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.6.2. </span>Token Supply<a class="headerlink" href="#token-supply" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin’s token supply is fixed and regulated. There will only
ever be 21 million bitcoin with the last bitcoin being
created around 2140. Satoshi Nakamoto intentionally create
this ‘coded inflation’ to simulate real-world inflation.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, the token, is generated through block rewards in the coinbase transaction.
The token reward that is assumed valid is actually the source of
Bitcoin inflation and all Bitcoin that ever existed was
created in a coinbase block reward.
This makes the block reward serve an elegant double-purpose,
both to incentivize the miner and act as a source of new Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Block rewards are dictated by software and, as we reach 21
million BTC created, halve every 210,000 blocks. The block
reward was initially over 50 BTC but as of 2022 is just 6.25 BTC.
Satoshi’s idea was that as time passed transaction fees would
make up for the lost block rewards.</p>
<p>While block rewards offer a source of inflation, errors on the
side of users or intentional acts by malicious ones offer a source of deflation.
Known as <em>burning</em>, this is when bitcoin tokens are lost and
take tokens out of <em>circulation</em>. This happens
every day and while bitcoin inflation is fixed this sort
of accidental deflation is not meaning that in the very long-term
the amount of <em>circulating</em> Bitcoin is likely to fall. Already,
an estimated 10% of create Bitcoins is presumed lost or
<em>unrecoverable</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.6.3. </span>Limitations &amp; Bitcoin’s Future<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations-bitcoins-future" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin was the project that introduced the world to Blockchain.
Being the first has its pros, namely recognition and first-mover
advantage, but it comes at the drawback of being antiquated. Bitcoin’s
creator disappeared in the early 2010s and without a central leader
major changes to Bitcoin look unlikely. This means that Bitcoin
is destined to remain the steam-powered ocean-liner of the blockchain
world. This is most evident in its lack of scalability, can process
3-4 transactions per second, inefficient consensus algorithm,
<em>PoW</em> has been criticized for being very energetically inefficient,
and limited functionality, Script is limited to transaction verification.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s drawbacks have lead to the creation of a large number of
competitor projects like Ethereum, Cardano or Litecoin. Many of these
competitors have active development teams supporting them so their
technological advantage over Bitcoin will only grow.</p>
<p>But not all hope is lost for Bitcoin. While the core project
will most likely never change in any large meaningful way there is
a community of developers trying to build <em>on top</em> of Bitcoin.
The most notable is <em>Layer 2</em> with projects such as the Lightning
Network or the Liquid Network. These projects significantly increase
Bitcoin’s scalability and reduce its dependence on <em>PoW</em>. We
also must not forget that as of 2022 Bitcoin is still the largest,
by market valuation, blockchain project and the most recognizable.
For many Bitcoin and blockchain are synonymous. As of 2022, Bitcoin has also
been adopted by governments such as El Salvador and Tonga with other
countries, like Bulgaria, owning significant amounts of Bitcoin. This all has bolstered
a group of people who believe Bitcoin is the ultimate blockchain
solution called <em>Bitcoin Maximalists</em>.</p>
