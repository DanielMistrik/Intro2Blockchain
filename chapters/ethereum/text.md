# Chapter
Throughout this textbook we have tried to build our blockchain step-by-step. For Ethereum, 
we can't quite do this. Ethereum is complicated, it achieves functionality through a complex
implementation that we will only scratch the surface of in this chapter.

## Ethereum Summary
Ethereum, unlike Litecoin or ZCash, is a blockchain completely separate from
Bitcoin. It was one of the first unique blockchain implementations after Bitcoin and 
as of 2022 is the second-largest blockchain by market valuation.
