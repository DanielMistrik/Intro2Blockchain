# Chapter
In the first chapter we described blockchain as a network which maintains
the blockchain data structure. In this chapter we will explore this network
and understand how its participants coordinate to keep the blockchain
data structure valid.

As a refresher the network is composed of potentially millions of 
computers, called *nodes*. *Nodes* are responsible for storing, adding to
and verified the blockchain data structure and as we will see they
come in many flavours. *Nodes* are often connected to each other in 
a random combination forming a web of connections that is the distributed
system of blockchain. This web is responsible for transporting any and
all information on/about the blockchain.

### PoW V PoS


## Maintaining the Network

{The big finish, go over the whole problem explain what we learned
in the first two chapters and explain the last puzzle piece and then
explain the whole thing}

This chapter concludes the basics. If you only wanted to 
know the basic building blocks of a blockchain congratulations, you now
know them. The next part of the textbook will take what we learned and
apply them to actual blockchain implementations. Up to now we were
largely in the idealistic theoretical realm but as you will see in the coming
chapters' implementation is not always clean.
