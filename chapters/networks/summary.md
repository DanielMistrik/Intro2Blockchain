# Summary
We covered how the blockchain network works. We went into the details
of how nodes coordinate to manage the blockchain data structure.
* The Blockchain network is a collection of nodes that store the same Blockchain data structure 
* Nodes are divided by their responsibilities into ‘full’ and ‘light’ categories.
* Nodes achieve consensus through a variety of algorithms with PoW and PoS being the primary ones.
* Miners/Stakers are nodes that are responsible for generating new blocks.
* There are different types of Blockchains depending on the use case they are trying to solve.
