# Summary
In this chapter we covered what cryptography is and how it acts as blockchain's backbone
guaranteeing its validity when participants are working in a trustless network. 
* Blockchain relies on two main cryptographic methods: Hashing and digital signatures/encryption
* Hashing is the process of taking an input of varying length and assigning it a unique fixed-sized output, a data signature.
* Digital Signatures allow you to verify the source of a message
* PPC allows for digital signatures through two pairs of keys, one is private the other is public
* Large Blockchain projects use a PPC method called ECDSA because of its small size and difficulty to crack
* From our public key we can generate an address which will serve as our cryptographic identity on the Blockchain allowing for pseudonymity.
